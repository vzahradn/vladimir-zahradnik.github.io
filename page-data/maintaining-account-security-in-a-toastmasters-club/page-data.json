What we can do is not to be quiet and to join the discussion with people of opposite views. Nobody is 100-percent correct, and we all can learn from each other. The key is to learn how to formulate your thoughts so the others can\\u2019t misinterpret you. Also, if possible, you should base your views on facts and mention them.
