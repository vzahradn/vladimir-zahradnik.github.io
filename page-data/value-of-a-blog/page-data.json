The trainer gave very specific tips on motivating members in the largest Slovak club to go into leadership roles. The basis of his methodology is to continuously classify members into several categories, the most important of which is whether the member is active or passive. As he explained this, I thought: \\u201CIn the largest club, where there are dozens of members, this system works very well. But what if the club has few members and most are passive?\\u201D\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It didn\\u2019t take long for someone to ask this question for me.

I am preparing a separate post on why this is important. If the club has a long-term vision, it continues to fulfill it despite management changes and doesn\\u2019t stagnate in one place. It is fundamental to determine what kind of members the club wants. Is it young mothers for whom speaking is a distraction from their duties? Or people who want to grow personally, challenge themselves, and escape their comfort zone every day? The managers can ask themselves more such questions, and the result is a basic vision of where they want the club to go in the long run.
