And, as a bonus, OpenWrt added support for it in their developer builds. Therefore, migration from my existing router to Raspberry Pi should be relatively painless.

I\\u2019m pleased that, finally, we have development boards capable of replacing network equipment. Such boards may shape the segment of home networking significantly in upcoming years.

However, instead of using an external USB-to-Ethernet adapter, the author used an Intel NIC. He was able to attain a throughput of 3 Gbit/s, which is the maximum of the PCIe x1 bus. Making the NIC work was not difficult at all. He used a cheap adapter to PCIe x16 and built the Intel NIC driver from sources.
