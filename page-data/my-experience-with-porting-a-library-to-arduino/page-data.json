The compilation process is much clearer, and I have more control over it. At the same time, all the library code is compiled, not just the selected parts, depending on how the Arduino IDE decides. When I compile under PlatformIO, I get rid of several issues. Debug prints are much more readable. And most importantly, in such a compiled project, printing to the serial line also works flawlessly.
